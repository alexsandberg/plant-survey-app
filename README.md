# Colorado Rare Plant Survey Application

## Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree - Capstone Project

This application is a citizen science tool for surveying rare plants in Colorado. Anyone can create a public account and record observations of rare plants they find while exploring Colorado's beautiful natural areas. These observations will help inform vital conservation efforts. Scientists and researchers with admin credentials can create and update listings of additional plants, adding to the database of plant species.

This tool is the capstone project for the [Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044), and it is intended to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas: 

* Data modeling
    * Architect relational database models in Python
    * Utilize SQLAlchemy to conduct database queries
* API Architecture and Testing
    * Follow RESTful principles of API development using Flask
    * Structure endpoints to perform CRUD operations, as well as error handling
    * Demonstrate validity of API behavior using the unittest library
* Third Party Authentication
    * Configure Role Based Authentication and roles-based access control (RBAC) in a Flask application utilizing Auth0
    * Decode and verify JWTs from Authorization headers
* Deployment
    * API is [hosted live via Heroku](https://plant-survey-tool.herokuapp.com/)


## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies
Developers using this project should already have Python3 and pip installed.

#### Backend Dependencies

Once you have cloned this project and your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the root directory and running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Server Locally

From within the root directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To set up the database, execute:
```
dropdb plant_survey
createdb plant_survey
psql plant_survey < plant_survey.psql
```

To run the development server, execute:

```
export DATABASE_URL=<local_database_path>
export FLASK_ENV=development
python3 app.py
```

## Testing
To run the tests, run
```
export ADMIN_ROLE_TOKEN=<active_admin_jwt>
export PUBLIC_ROLE_TOKEN=<active_public_jwt>
dropdb plant_survey_test
createdb plant_survey_test
psql plant_survey_test < plant_survey.psql
python3 test_app.py
```
Omit the dropdb command the first time you run tests.

## API Reference

### Getting Started

* Base URL: Plant and observations data can be accessed directly through the API, using the base URL `https://plant-survey-tool.herokuapp.com/api`. Alternatively, follow directions above to run the application locally.
* Authentication: Most endpoints require either Public or Admin permissions. This version does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON in the following format:<br>

    {
        "success": False,
        "error": 404,
        "message": "resource not found"
    }

The API will return the following types of errors:

* 400 – bad request
* 401 – unauthorized
* 401 – authorization_header_missing
* 404 – resource not found
* 405 – method not allowed
* 422 – unprocessable

### Endpoints

#### GET /plants

  * Returns a list plants with associated observations.
  * Does not require authorization.
* Sample request: 
    ```bash
    curl https://plant-survey-tool.herokuapp.com/plants
    ```
* Response:
    ```
